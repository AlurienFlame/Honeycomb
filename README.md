# A\* Pathfinding in a hexagonal grid

Use interactive tools to place obstacles or build mazes on a hexagonal grid, then press play and watch the algorithm explore.
Slow down time to get a closer look at what's happening, or even step through the process frame by frame.

#### What do the numbers mean?
The bottom three numbers are cubic co-ordinates representing the hex's position.

Bottom left: X
Bottom middle: Y
Bottom right: Z

The top three numbers are the values assigned to the hex by the algorithm.

Top left: g-cost - Distance to start
Top right: h-cost - Distance to end
Top middle: f-cost -  Sum of both distances
